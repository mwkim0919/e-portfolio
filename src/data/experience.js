      "The research I assisted involves measuring of fibre length and lignin content in Arabidopsis samples in order to identify a specific gene that contributes to the properties of its fibre length and lignin content. Determining the gene associated to fibre length and lignin content in Arabidopsis can help the development of paper industry and reduce environmental and economic demands on common wood sources as these properties are significant to formation of paper products.",

      "I assisted a research in which the goal is to develop and optimize super-capacitors. A super-capacitor is an emerging technology that is used in various electronic applications such as hybrid vehicles and smartphones. Due to the potential that super-capacitors can bring to the current and future technology, the significance level of super-capacitor research is extremely high. My work here involved synthesis of super-capacitor materials using various methods and compositions and analysis of super-capacitor's properties.",
